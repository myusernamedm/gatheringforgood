Expect to welcome them at least every few years, if not every year. What about the effect on animal life? How would you like your grandchildren to swim in oceans full of jellyfish because most marine life is gone? Jellyfish on one hand are similar to some plants in their simplicity, yet mobile like animals but with an incredible ability to reproduce rapidly under favourable conditions. So the conditions humans are creating in our oceans which kill off turtles, fish, dolphins and the other marine life we all know and love, have no or little effect on jellyfish which have already started to multiple rapidly in the absence of their natural predators. In recent years, Japan has suffered from annual massive Nomura jellyfish blooms, clogging fishing nets and devastating fish populations. If that’s not worrying enough, it is also likely that there are many species of jellyfish which are equally suffering from the ecological destruction humans are waging on the planet. So what about all those exotic animals many of us grew up familiar with from watching on tv? They will soon have nowhere left to live. And the really scary thing…they won’t be gone in the context of some arbitrary purchase you can make which can be replaced next month. Extinction is coldly final and 100% permanent. For the next billions of years of the universe, long after every person living right now is gone, the animals we drove to extinction will never exist again.";

It is in this context that the leader of the worlds biggest polluting country has decided not to attend. The UN Secretary General has said that the alarm bells are deafening, and there are lots of sound bites coming from ‘the great and the good’, but will it actually lead to any meaningful change? More importantly for people used to a certain standard of living, and no matter how much we try to pretend otherwise, humans do not want to sacrifice their quality of life in the fight against an intangible and intermittent threat.

The world is on fire both figuratively and literally, and across the planet the different species who inhabit the planet as their only home are choking on the fumes. But there is hope, there is hope in the huge percentage of new energy coming from renewables worldwide. There is hope in the growing awareness of all generations of the urgency of the crises. There is hope that with awareness, comes an increasing willingness to make individual change. There is an old saying that you cannot eat an elephant in one bite; but lots of moderate changes by billons of people can have an impact.
